	The  variables  in  main, 	 such  as  line,  longest,  etc.,  are  private  or  local  to 
main.  Because  they  are  declared  within  main,  no  other  function  can  have 
direct  access  to  them.  The  same  is  true  of  the  variables  in  other  functions;  for 
example,  the  variable  i  in  	getline  is  unrelated  to  the  i  in  copy.  Each  local 
variable  in  a  function  comes  into  existence  only  when  the  function  is  called,  and 
disappears  when  the  function  is  exited.  This  is  why  such  variables  are  usually 
known  as  automatic  variables,  following  terminology  in  other  languages.  We 
will  use  the  term  automatic  henceforth  to  refer  to  these  local  variables. 
(Chapter  4  discusses  the  static  storage  class,  in  which  local  variables  do 
retain  their  values  between  calls.)
