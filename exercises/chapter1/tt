This is a short line.
This is a longer line that should be printed because it exceeds the 80 character limit. It contains more than 80 characters and should be handled correctly by your program.
Another short line.
Here is another long line that also exceeds the 80 character limit. This line is designed to test the program's ability to handle long lines and ensure that it prints them correctly.
Short line again.
This is yet another long line that goes beyond the 80 character limit. The program should print this line in its entirety, including any additional characters that come after the 80th character.
